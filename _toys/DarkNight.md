title: DarkNight
description: >
  Launch agent that synchronizes dark mode on macOS with the activation of Night Shift, using reverse-engineered APIs from the CoreBrightness and SkyLight frameworks. Also allows for running a script to "complete" the transition for apps that don't use the system appearance API or have not linked with the macOS Mojave SDK.
