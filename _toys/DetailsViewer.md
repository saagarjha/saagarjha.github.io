  Originally a macOS Mail plugin (written in Swift, so beware!) to show extra details, but is now approaching a state where it's a dumping ground of random things I wish Mail did. Currently auto-expands the "Details" button in messages (hence the name), and adds tooltips to messages in the list view.
