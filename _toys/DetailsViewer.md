description: >
  Originally a macOS Mail plugin (<strike>written in Swift, so beware!</strike> just run-of-the-mill swizzling concerns now that ABI stability is here) to show extra details, but is now approaching a state where it's a dumping ground of random things I wish Mail did. Currently auto-expands the "Details" button in messages (hence the name), and adds tooltips to messages in the list view.
