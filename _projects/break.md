description: >
  iOS app for students attending schools that use <a href="https://schoolloop.com">School Loop</a>. Offers a bunch of features over the official app, with the primary one being that it's 100% native Swift, allowing it to take advantage of APIs that aren't available to the Cordova/Ionic/Phonegap official application such as notifications, a watchOS app extension, and support for 3D Touch, SFSafariViewController, and biometric authentication. It also adds some other nice features such as grade calculation and access to the locker.
