# Hi, I'm Saagar Jha.
I'm a high school senior at Monta Vista High School in Cupertino, California. I love working with computers and technology of all kinds. You can check out some of my work on my [projects]({{ site.url }}/projects) and [toys]({{ site.url }}/toys) pages. I also post some stuff on my [blog]({{ site.url }}/blog) from time to time. Still curious? I have a [portfolio]({{ site.url }}/about/portfolio) of things I've created in high school as well.

## Contact me
Got a question? Need to talk to me? [Email](mailto:saagar@saagarjha.com) is usually the best way to get ahold of me for general stuff, but I also have online accounts as well, which may or may not be a better choice:

- [@saagarjha](https://github.com/saagarjha) on Github
- [@saagarjha](https://bitbucket.org/saagarjha/) on Bitbucket

## About this website
I purchased the domain for this website through the [Google Domains](https://domains.google/) registrar, and it is hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com). The website is statically generated using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) from a set of Markdown and Sassy CSS files. I'm not a web developer or designer by any means, so this website may break or not display correctly. If this happens (and you're using a modern browser), please do let me know an I'll try to fix it. This website is still in construction, so things may change rapidly as I work on it (this is also the reason why the repository backing this website is currently private).
