# Hi, I'm Saagar Jha.
I'm a software developer from Cupertino, California, but I spend an inordinate amount of time in southern California. You can check out some of my work on my [projects]({{ site.url }}/projects) and [toys]({{ site.url }}/toys) pages. I also post some stuff on my [blog]({{ site.url }}/blog) from time to time. Still curious? You can find my resume [here]({{ site.url }}/resume.pdf).

## Contact me
Got a question? Need to talk to me? [Email](mailto:saagar@saagarjha.com) is usually the best way to get a hold of me for general stuff, but I also have online accounts as well, which may or may not be a better choice, depending on what you're trying to contact me about:

## About this website
I purchased the domain for this website through the [Google Domains](https://domains.google/) registrar, and it's hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). The website itself is statically generated using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) from a set of [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and [Sassy CSS](http://sass-lang.com) files. I'm not a web developer or designer by any means, so this website may break or not display correctly. If this happens (and you're using a modern browser), please do let me know and I'll try to fix it.
